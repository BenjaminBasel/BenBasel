### Description:
Project Contributer(s): Benjamin Basel

In 2020 Benjamin's Design and Manufacturing Class gave a weeklong individual assignment to create a 'cool-looking model' using Solidworks as part of a trophy design competition. The designs submitted by the 90+ students went through a multiple voting-based elimination rounds before Benjamin's turtle trophy design was announced as one of the three winning designs.
