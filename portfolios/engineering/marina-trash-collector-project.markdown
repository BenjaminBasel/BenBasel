### Description:
Project Contributer(s): Benjamin Basel, CCCC

In 2020 Benjamin's Design and Manufacturing Class gave a Semester-long assignment to sketch, present, and design prototype and finalized moodels of an original product. As member of a 4 person team, Benjamin designed the Floor Seat and was given full marks. Benjamin's role was the primary designer and as such, he designed every original part below with the exception of the bottom seat plate and seat cushion.
