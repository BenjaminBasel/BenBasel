### Description:
Personal Project

In 2020 Benjamin Basel launched benjaminbasel.github.io for use as a personal portfolio website. He used the Ruby language along with the software: Git bash, Github Desktop, Github Pages, Visual Studio Code, and Jekyll in order to set up the development environment and as as well as hosting of the website. The open source theme jekyll-teXt-theme was installed with ruby to function as the base theme and framework for the website. He then used the languages SCSS, HTML, and Markdown to create the content of the site as well as to edit the teXt jekyll theme's layouts and framework.
