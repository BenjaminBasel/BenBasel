### Description:
Project Contributer(s): Benjamin Basel

In 2019 Benjamin was given an assignment to design and build an electric motor from scratch as a member of a 3 person team. In order to resolve inconclusive discussions on the best wiring and magnet configurations for the design, he used Processing 3.0 to create a program in order to map the force vectorfield produced by an input magnet configuration as well as to calculate the forces applied to a three coil rotor rotating in the center with input electric current directions. Further updating and bugclearing has been performed up to the present date.
